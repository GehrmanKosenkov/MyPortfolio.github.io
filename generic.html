									<h1>My Story<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>Russian guy with a German name and Swedish roots living in Cyprus after 5 years of life in the UK.</p>

								<p>I was born in a “shipping family”. Since the teenagerhood my father was taking me to meetings with clients and colleagues at country houses. Those meetings gave me opportunities to meet and chat with commodity traders. That’s when my interest in the industry ignited. I fell in love with the dynamic world of commodity trade. </p>
								<p>To learn more about the transportation of bulk commodities I decided to do an internship as a demurrage analyst at Solar Shipping. This internship helped to build up my numerical and analytical skills and allowed me to learn about dry bulk trade.  </p>
								<p>After finishing my secondary school in 2018, I went to the UK to study Maritime Business and Trade at Plymouth University. I was eager to gain some hands-on working experience as soon as possible. Already in my 1 course I got a job at a London-based consulting company EA. I became the CEO’s right-hand and had a diverse set of responsibilities. Among other things, I was running the company’s books, assisting the accountant with the production of various financial reports, performing an analysis of transactions in SQL and Excel, conducting ad hoc research. </p>
								<p>Despite having an interesting and well-paid job, I was keen to start making my first steps in the commodity industry. In January 2021, I was hired as an analyst by a London-based fund AlmaStone. The fund provides financing to agricultural traders in emerging markets. I was involved in various types of analyzes including market analysis, financial analysis, and KYC. I was also preparing investment memos and investment proposals. Besides, every week I was presenting various market updates to the team which helped me to build up my storytelling and presentation skills. My time at AlmaStone was exciting and full of learning. I gained knowledge about agricultural markets, enhanced my analytical and technical skills including SQL, Python, Excel. Although my full-time contact with AlmaStone ended in May 2022, I still assist the company with analytical projects from time to time.</p>
								<p>Last 7 months I was exploring the ship management industry. I was doing a business development consulting project for a shipping IT company Krew Guru. Krew Guru owns a platform for seafarer search and hiring to which I was brining leading ship management companies (Including BSM, Marlow, Vships etc.). This project gave me an opportunity to sense the difference between an analytical job and a commercial job. It enabled me to make an informed decision to continue building my analyst career in commodities and shipping field.<p>
								<p>My interest in data analysis is powered by my curiosity and desire to find the truth. I feel myself like a detective investigating a murder. First, I ask questions. Is it an accidental death, suicide, or a murder? If it’s a murder, is it a deliberate murder? Do we have witnesses? Suspects? (Asking Right Questions and Defining Analysis Goals). Next, I search for clues and evidence. I speak with witnesses, I investigate a place of an alleged murder etc. (Data Gathering and Research). At the next stage, I organize and clean the evidence. I put all bits and pieces into folders and boxes making sure everything is in order (Data Cleaning and Organization). Next, I try to make sense of the collected facts and clues. Try to connect the dots. I use deduction, lab equipment, Interrogation, and other resources available to me. Is the killer the butler? (Data Analysis). Then, when conclusions are made, I present my position to my boss. I need to communicate the facts in a clear manner and probably provide recommendations on how to act (Data Sharing; Providing Recommendations on How to Act). <p>
								<p>My job done. At the next stage, a court will decide a fate of a defendant.<p>
